# Project 1 Storm Viewer1

Get started coding in Swift by making an image viewer app and learning key concepts.

Do not care about the white area on the right side, they are just some test projects I create long ago.

- Click **Create a new Xcode project** on the bottom left, then Xcode will show us a page like below, choose macOS on the top, and choose App in the Application frame,click next on the bottom right.
