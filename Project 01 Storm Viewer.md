# Project 1 Storm Viewer1

Get started coding in Swift by making an image viewer app and learning key concepts.

In this chapter, we will create a simple app step by step, to make sure that I can do it myself in the future.

# Launch Xcode and create a project

1. First open Xcode.app and it will show you a window like this:

Do not care about the white area on the right side, they are just some test projects I create long ago.

- Click **Create a new Xcode project** on the bottom left, then Xcode will show us a page like below, choose macOS on the top, and choose App in the Application frame,click next on the bottom right.

- Xcode will ask us some information it needs, please check as below:

  - on the **Product Name text field**,enter our project name "StormView"; 
  - choose **Team** as none;
  - choose **Organization Name** whatever you like;
  - don't DIY the **Organization Identifier**, Xcode will do it for us;
  - choose **Language** as Swift;
  - **User Interface** choose Storyboard;
  - uncheck the **Create Document-Based Application**;
  - leave Document Extension as empty;
  - uncheck **Use Core Data**;
  - uncheck **Use CloudKit**;
  - uncheck **Include Unit Tests**;
  - uncheck **Include UI Tests**.

  Finally your choice will like below:

- Next page, Xcode will ask where to store this project, find a path to store it, that's simple, or you can create a **New Folder** to store it:

Finally, your Xcode interface will look like this:
