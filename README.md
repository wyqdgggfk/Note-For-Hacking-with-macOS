# Note For Hacking with macOS
 This is just a note for Hacking with macOS,I create this repository for macOS App develop learning,the original author is Paul Hudson,everyone can buy his ebooks on www.hackingwithswift.com. Don't be care about the money,the only thing you should think is how to earn money back when you finish studying,not how to save money,after all,it worth.

Before your read this note,I recommendly suggest you to buy a Mac,even a Mac mini,don't use a black Apple machine,that's totally a nightmare,and if your boss tell you to use a black Apple machine for financial saving, maybe you should consider to leave this company.

I'll try my best to make some practise on this book,but if there is any mistake,please tell me.
